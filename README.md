# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub. I am always excited to learn something new. So enjoy the ride with me. Hi there, I am the CTO of Tech From Vets. I plan to learn more of coding to diversify my knowledge with technology. Again, I enjoy everything so far because I want to be this great coder and CTO. Also, I have apps to finish as well. 
These changes I am making to this readme file will help me understand GitHub. Also, these changes are helping me learn what commit is all about.
